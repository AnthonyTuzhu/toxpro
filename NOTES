### BASIC SETUP

Getting started using the Flask tutorial: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/tutorial

https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xix-deployment-on-docker-containers


command for pushing image to docker hub

docker tag nanodb:latest danrusso/nanodb:latest
docker push danrusso/nanodb


command for starting docker on digital ocean

need to remove image first to make sure it pulls from repo after update

sudo docker run -p 80:5000 -v /c/Users/russod/Projects/toxpro/logs:/home/toxpro/logs -v /c/Users/russod/Projects/toxpro/data:/home/tox/data/ --env NANO_FILE_DIR=/home/tox/data --name toxpro -d -t toxpro

I was getting a exec ./boot.sh: no such file or directory


turns out i was getting removing windows style line endings this solved the problem:

helpful notes:

SQLALCHEMY and app factories:https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/patterns/appfactories/

started using flask migrations: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-iv-database

flask db init to intializaize db

## Redis Queue

Redis Queue is a way to handle background tasks/jobs.  It requires a seperate server and installation outside
of python.

Docker should be good for this: https://www.docker.com/blog/how-to-use-the-redis-docker-official-image/

Here is a tutorial for using it with flask: https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-xxii-background-jobs


There are two commands that need to be run to get the redis server runnign using docker.  The first is to start the redis
container using:

```
docker run --name my-redis -p 6379:6379 redis
```

then in a separate terminal need to start the RQ worker.  This needs to be done with the ToxPro env

```
rq worker toxpro-tasks
```
